clust-31	gamma-clust65	deg-clust65	entero-clust57	endo-clust46	-	CLPB	Part of a stress-induced multi-chaperone system, it is involved in the recovery of the cell from heat-induced damage, in cooperation with DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE. Acts before DnaK, in the processing of protein aggregates. Protein binding stimulates the ATPase activity
clust-32	deg-clust74	entero-clust168	gamma-clust74	endo-clust56	Oxidative phosphorylation /Metabolic pathways	NUOC	NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron- sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient (By similarity)
