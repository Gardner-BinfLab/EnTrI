clust-2	entero-clust168	endo-clust56	deg-clust87	gamma-clust87	Oxidative phosphorylation /Metabolic pathways	NUOC	NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron- sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient (By similarity)
clust-13	entero-clust967	endo-clust185	endo-clust201	deg-clust154	entero-clust1071	gamma-clust154	Lipoic acid metabolism /Metabolic pathways	LIPA	Catalyzes the radical-mediated insertion of two sulfur atoms into the C-6 and C-8 positions of the octanoyl moiety bound to the lipoyl domains of lipoate-dependent enzymes, thereby converting the octanoylated domains into lipoylated derivatives (By similarity)
clust-20	endo-clust46	entero-clust57	deg-clust72	gamma-clust72	-	CLPB	Part of a stress-induced multi-chaperone system, it is involved in the recovery of the cell from heat-induced damage, in cooperation with DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE. Acts before DnaK, in the processing of protein aggregates. Protein binding stimulates the ATPase activity
