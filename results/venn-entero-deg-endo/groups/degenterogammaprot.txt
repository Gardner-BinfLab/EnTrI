clust-105	deg-clust4	prot-clust4	entero-clust3	gamma-clust4	-	MUKB	Plays a central role in chromosome condensation, segregation and cell cycle progression. Functions as a homodimer, which is essential for chromosome partition. Involved in negative DNA supercoiling in vivo, and by this means organize and compact chromosomes. May achieve or facilitate chromosome segregation by condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome during cell division (By similarity)
clust-128	gamma-clust303	prot-clust303	entero-clust554	deg-clust303	Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism /Metabolic pathways /Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites	CYSG	Multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the SAM-dependent methylation of uroporphyrinogen III at position C-2 and C-7 to form precorrin-2 and then position C-12 or C-18 to form trimethylpyrrocorphin 2. It also catalyzes the conversion of precorrin-2 into siroheme. This reaction consists of the NAD- dependent oxidation of precorrin-2 into sirohydrochlorin and its subsequent ferrochelation into siroheme (By similarity)
