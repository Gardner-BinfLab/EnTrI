clust-24	gamma-clust4	deg-clust4	prot-clust4	entero-clust3	-	MUKB	Plays a central role in chromosome condensation, segregation and cell cycle progression. Functions as a homodimer, which is essential for chromosome partition. Involved in negative DNA supercoiling in vivo, and by this means organize and compact chromosomes. May achieve or facilitate chromosome segregation by condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome during cell division (By similarity)
