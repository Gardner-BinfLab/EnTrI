clust-185	deg-clust97	endo-clust76	entero-clust837	-	WCAJ	transferase
clust-199	deg-clust253	endo-clust87	entero-clust279	ABC transporters	MDLA	Involved in lipid A export and possibly also in glycerophospholipid export and for biogenesis of the outer membrane. Transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pore in the inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain (NBD) is responsible for energy generation (By similarity)
clust-220	deg-clust7	entero-clust67	endo-clust8	Two-component system	BARA	Histidine kinase
clust-221	deg-clust383	endo-clust67	entero-clust453	Arginine and proline metabolism /Metabolic pathways	PATA	Catalyzes the aminotransferase reaction from putrescine to 2-oxoglutarate, leading to glutamate and 4-aminobutanal, which spontaneously cyclizes to form 1-pyrroline. Is also able to transaminate cadaverine and, in lower extent, spermidine, but not ornithine (By similarity)
clust-223	deg-clust70	entero-clust575	endo-clust139	-	MLTF	Murein-degrading enzyme that degrades murein glycan strands and insoluble, high-molecular weight murein sacculi, with the concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product. Lytic transglycosylases (LTs) play an integral role in the metabolism of the peptidoglycan (PG) sacculus. Their lytic action creates space within the PG sacculus to allow for its expansion as well as for the insertion of various structures such as secretion systems and flagella (By similarity)
