Catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of (R)-beta-lysine produced by EpmB, forming a lysyl-adenylate, from which the beta- lysyl moiety is then transferred to the epsilon-amino group of a conserved specific lysine residue in EF-P (By similarity)

Binds to the hydrophobic signal sequence of the ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) as it emerges from the ribosomes. The SRP-RNC complex is then targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane where it interacts with the SRP receptor FtsY. Interaction with FtsY leads to the transfer of the RNC complex to the Sec translocase for insertion into the membrane, the hydrolysis of GTP by both Ffh and FtsY, and the dissociation of the SRP-FtsY complex into the individual components (By similarity)
