03	Porphyromonas gingivalis strain ATCC 33277-short
04	does not provide the list of short genes, but genes which have either less than 10 TA sites or were less than 150 bp in length were disregarded.
05	Ignoring short genes not mentioned and there's no list of short genes.
#06	does not provide the list of short genes, should be ommited from the study as it shows the intersection between essential genes in different conditions.
07	does not exclude short genes.
08	does not exclude short genes.
09	does not exclude short genes.
10	does not exclude short genes. Table S4
11	does not exclude short genes.

19	is.essential = Y, does not exclude short genes.
20	In the first column (the first column is for rich medium) named "Essential?" count number of columns with value essential. does not exclude short genes.
#21	should be ommited from the study as it shows the intersection of essential genes in PAO1 and PA14 strains. does not exclude short genes.
22	first tab, NA shows excluded genes
#23	Should be excluded from the study as it studies essential genes in minimal medium. Column E shows essential genes with Ess. N.A. and T.C. are excluded.
24	does not exclude short genes.
25	does not exclude short genes, essential: I < 3 and J < 3.
26	does not exclude short genes, essential: Tn-hits==0
27	does not exclude short genes, essential: Disrupted in current study = blank
28	excluded genes < 1 kb. Table S2 shows essential genes.
29	does not exclude short genes.
30	does not exclude short genes.
31	essential: c==y, genes with less than 4 insertion sites are excluded, but we don't know which genes have less than 4 insertion sites.
