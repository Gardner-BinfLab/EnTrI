Inherit from proNOG: tautomerase	0	6
Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation elongation and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage occurs between the second and third residue of the Lys codon followed by a G or A (5'AAA(G A)3'), is reading-frame dependent and occurs within the 5' end of most mRNAs. Ribosome-binding confers the sequence specificity and reading frame-dependence. When overexpressed in liquid media YafQ partially inhibits protein synthesis, with a reduction in growth rate and colony growth rate. This effect is counteracted by coexpression with DinJ, the YafQ antitoxin. YafQ and DinJ together bind their own promoter, and by analogy to other TA modules probably repress its expression	0	6

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. ChpB is a sequence-specific mRNA and (weak) tmRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage is independent of the ribosome. Cleavage occurs at ACY sequences where Y is not C. The endoribonuclease activity is not as strong as that of MazF. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin ChpS. Toxicity results when the levels of ChpS decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. Both ChpS and ChpB probably bind to the promoter region of the chpSB operon to autoregulate their synthesis	0	4

swimming returnes to normal when residues 206-207 are both mutated to Ala. Overexpression also leads to a reduction in flagellar abundance and a 20-fold increase in c-di- GMP levels in vivo. Required for aminoglycoside-mediated induction of biofilm formation, it also plays a lesser role in biofilm production in response to other classes of translation inhibitors. The c-di-GMP produced by this enzyme up-regulates poly-GlcNAc production as well as the biofilm synthesis protein PgaD, although c-di-GMP is probably not the main inducing principle. Cyclic-di- GMP is a second messenger which controls cell surface-associated traits in bacteria	0	3

these effects are overcome by concomitant expression of antitoxin SohA (PrlF). Massive overexpression is toxic.

The complex is essential to convert dimers of the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation at cell division. It also contributes to the segregational stability of plasmids.

An mRNA interferase which has been reported to be translation- independent (PubMed 19690171, PubMed 19943910) and translation- dependent (PubMed 20041169). Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed 19690171) but also after C in GC(A U) sequences (PubMed 19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity.

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. MazF is a sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. It is very stable, single- strand specific and cleavage is independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs. Cleavage usually occurs between the first A and C of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. MazF- mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Programmed cell death occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazEF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence NNWNN, probably produced from the zwg gene product glucose-6- phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. Both MazE and MazEF bind to the promoter region of the mazEF operon to inhibit their transcription	0	1

Interacts with a short DNA sequence about one-quarter of the way into the major capsid protein gene 23 of T4, and the inhibition occurs when this late gene of the virus is expressed	0	1
Involved in the transfer of galactofuranose (Galf) onto an alpha-D-gluco-configured acceptor substrate to form a beta-1,6- linkage. It uses n-octyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside as an acceptor substrate for the addition of galactofuranose from the donor substrate UDP-galactofuranose. It is not able to use beta-D- glucopyranoside isomers	0	1
