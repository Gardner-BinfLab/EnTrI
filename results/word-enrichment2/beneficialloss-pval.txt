Inhibits RpoS proteolysis by regulating RssB activity, thereby increasing the stability of the sigma stress factor RpoS especially during phosphate starvation, but also in stationary phase and during nitrogen starvation. Its effect on RpoS stability is due to its interaction with RssB, which probably blocks the interaction of RssB with RpoS, and the consequent delivery of the RssB-RpoS complex to the ClpXP protein degradation pathway (By similarity)	2.10274075405142e-15	1.58196196063135e-12

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation elongation and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage occurs between the second and third residue of the Lys codon followed by a G or A (5'AAA(G A)3'), is reading-frame dependent and occurs within the 5' end of most mRNAs. Ribosome-binding confers the sequence specificity and reading frame-dependence. When overexpressed in liquid media YafQ partially inhibits protein synthesis, with a reduction in growth rate and colony growth rate. This effect is counteracted by coexpression with DinJ, the YafQ antitoxin.

Alteration of the phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane causes membrane ruffling and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements.

During stationary phase, binds the chromosome non- specifically, forming a highly ordered and stable dps-DNA co- crystal within which chromosomal DNA is condensed and protected from diverse damages. It protects DNA from oxidative damage by sequestering intracellular Fe(2 ) ion and storing it in the form of Fe(3 ) oxyhydroxide mineral, which can be released after reduction.

swimming returnes to normal when residues 206-207 are both mutated to Ala. Overexpression also leads to a reduction in flagellar abundance and a 20-fold increase in c-di- GMP levels in vivo. Required for aminoglycoside-mediated induction of biofilm formation, it also plays a lesser role in biofilm production in response to other classes of translation inhibitors. The c-di-GMP produced by this enzyme up-regulates poly-GlcNAc production as well as the biofilm synthesis protein PgaD, although c-di-GMP is probably not the main inducing principle.

Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed 19690171) but also after C in GC(A U) sequences (PubMed 19943910).

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. ChpB is a sequence-specific mRNA and (weak) tmRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage is independent of the ribosome. Cleavage occurs at ACY sequences where Y is not C. The endoribonuclease activity is not as strong as that of MazF. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin ChpS. Toxicity results when the levels of ChpS decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. Both ChpS and ChpB probably bind to the promoter region of the chpSB operon to autoregulate their synthesis	1	1

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A stable (half-life 27.6 minutes) endoribonuclease that in the absence of cognate antitoxin RnlB causes generalized RNA degradation. Degrades late enterobacteria phage T4 mRNAs, protecting the host against T4 reproduction. Activity is inhibited by cognate antitoxin RnlB and by enterobacteria phage T4 protein Dmd.

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. MazF is a sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. It is very stable, single- strand specific and cleavage is independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs. Cleavage usually occurs between the first A and C of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. MazF- mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Programmed cell death occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazEF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence NNWNN, probably produced from the zwg gene product glucose-6- phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. Both MazE and MazEF bind to the promoter region of the mazEF operon to inhibit their transcription	1	1
