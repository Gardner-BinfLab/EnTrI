STMMW_10191	The RecE (also known as exonuclease VIII) pathway is an alternative pathway for the initiation of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. The RecE pathway is activated in recB, recC sbcA (suppressors of recB and recC) mutants. Activation of the RecE pathway results in the production of at least two phage proteins relevant for recombinational repair. RecE is a duplex DNA-specific exonuclease which produces 3' overhangs in duplex DNA by preferentially degrading the 5'-ending strands. Recombinational repair of E.coli chromosomal DNA involves as well other proteins RecA, RecF, RecJ, RecO, RecR, and RuvC

SL1344_0897	Transcriptional regulator
SL1344_0898	Essential cell division protein that coordinates cell division and chromosome segregation. The N-terminus is involved in assembly of the cell-division machinery. The C-terminus functions as a DNA motor that moves dsDNA in an ATP-dependent manner towards the dif recombination site, which is located within the replication terminus region. Translocation stops specifically at Xer-dif sites, where FtsK interacts with the Xer recombinase, allowing activation of chromosome unlinking by recombination. FtsK orienting polar sequences (KOPS) guide the direction of DNA translocation. FtsK can remove proteins from DNA as it translocates, but translocation stops specifically at XerCD-dif site, thereby preventing removal of XerC and XerD from dif

The RecE pathway is activated in recB, recC sbcA (suppressors of recB and recC) mutants. Activation of the RecE pathway results in the production of at least two phage proteins relevant for recombinational repair. RecE is a duplex DNA-specific exonuclease which produces 3' overhangs in duplex DNA by preferentially degrading the 5'-ending strands. Recombinational repair of E.coli chromosomal DNA involves as well other proteins RecA, RecF, RecJ, RecO, RecR, and RuvC

BW25113_1350	The RecE (also known as exonuclease VIII) pathway is an alternative pathway for the initiation of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. The RecE pathway is activated in recB, recC sbcA (suppressors of recB and recC) mutants. Activation of the RecE pathway results in the production of at least two phage proteins relevant for recombinational repair. RecE is a duplex DNA-specific exonuclease which produces 3' overhangs in duplex DNA by preferentially degrading the 5'-ending strands. Recombinational repair of E.coli chromosomal DNA involves as well other proteins RecA, RecF, RecJ, RecO, RecR, and RuvC

BW25113_2781	nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase
BW25113_2782	Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. MazF is a sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. It is very stable, single- strand specific and cleavage is independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs. Cleavage usually occurs between the first A and C of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. MazF- mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Programmed cell death occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazEF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence NNWNN, probably produced from the zwg gene product glucose-6- phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. Both MazE and MazEF bind to the promoter region of the mazEF operon to inhibit their transcription

BW25113_3022	Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. An mRNA interferase which has been reported to be translation- independent (PubMed 19690171, PubMed 19943910) and translation- dependent (PubMed 20041169). Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed 19690171) but also after C in GC(A U) sequences (PubMed 19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity. Overexpression causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation as well as increasing persister cell formation

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands.

SL3261_2532	The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (sugar PTS), a major carbohydrate active -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitantly with their translocation across the cell membrane.

ERS227112_00535	The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (sugar PTS), a major carbohydrate active -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitantly with their translocation across the cell membrane. This system is involved in N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) transport, yielding cytoplasmic MurNAc-6-P. Is also able to take up anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc), but cannot phosphorylate the carbon 6, probably because of the 1,6-anhydro ring (By similarity)
ERS227112_00536	Specifically catalyzes the cleavage of the D-lactyl ether substituent of MurNAc 6-phosphate, producing GlcNAc 6- phosphate and D-lactate. Together with AnmK, is also required for the utilization of anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc) either imported from the medium or derived from its own cell wall murein, and thus plays a role in cell wall recycling (By similarity)

This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released. If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB subunit that will check the other stand for damage (By similarity)
