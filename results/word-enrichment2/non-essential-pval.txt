The RecE (also known as exonuclease VIII) pathway is an alternative pathway for the initiation of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. The RecE pathway is activated in recB, recC sbcA (suppressors of recB and recC) mutants. Activation of the RecE pathway results in the production of at least two phage proteins relevant for recombinational repair. RecE is a duplex DNA-specific exonuclease which produces 3' overhangs in duplex DNA by preferentially degrading the 5'-ending strands. Recombinational repair of E.coli chromosomal DNA involves as well other proteins RecA, RecF, RecJ, RecO, RecR, and RuvC	0.43147399925795	0.956582438867674

Site-specific tyrosine recombinase, which acts by catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining DNA molecules. Binds cooperatively to specific DNA consensus sequences that are separated from XerD binding sites by a short central region, forming the heterotetrameric XerC-XerD complex that recombines DNA substrates. The complex is essential to convert dimers of the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation at cell division. It also contributes to the segregational stability of plasmids.

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. MazF is a sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. It is very stable, single- strand specific and cleavage is independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs. Cleavage usually occurs between the first A and C of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by the labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. MazF- mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Programmed cell death occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazEF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence NNWNN, probably produced from the zwg gene product glucose-6- phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. Both MazE and MazEF bind to the promoter region of the mazEF operon to inhibit their transcription	0.679845219126994	1

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation elongation and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage occurs between the second and third residue of the Lys codon followed by a G or A (5'AAA(G A)3'), is reading-frame dependent and occurs within the 5' end of most mRNAs. Ribosome-binding confers the sequence specificity and reading frame-dependence. When overexpressed in liquid media YafQ partially inhibits protein synthesis, with a reduction in growth rate and colony growth rate. This effect is counteracted by coexpression with DinJ, the YafQ antitoxin.

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). CRISPR clusters contain sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA)	1	1

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. An mRNA interferase which has been reported to be translation- independent (PubMed 19690171, PubMed 19943910) and translation- dependent (PubMed 20041169). Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed 19690171) but also after C in GC(A U) sequences (PubMed 19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity. Overexpression causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation as well as increasing persister cell formation	1	1
