As ProRS can inadvertently accommodate and process non-cognate amino acids such as alanine and cysteine, to avoid such errors it has two additional distinct editing activities against alanine. One activity is designated as 'pretransfer' editing and involves the tRNA(Pro)-independent hydrolysis of activated Ala-AMP. The other activity is designated 'posttransfer' editing and involves deacylation of mischarged Ala-tRNA(Pro). The misacylated Cys- tRNA(Pro) is not edited by ProRS (By similarity)	Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis - Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655
