b0083	FTSL	Essential cell division protein. May link together the upstream cell division proteins, which are predominantly cytoplasmic, with the downstream cell division proteins, which are predominantly periplasmic (By similarity)	NA	3
b0631	YBED	UPF0250 protein	NA	3
b0641	RLPB	Rare lipoprotein B	NA	3
b0684	FLDA	Low-potential electron donor to a number of redox enzymes (By similarity)	NA	5
b0922	MUKF	Involved in chromosome condensation, segregation and cell cycle progression. May participate in facilitating chromosome segregation by condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome during cell division. Not required for mini-F plasmid partitioning. Probably acts via its interaction with MukB and MukE. Overexpression results in anucleate cells. It has a calcium binding activity (By similarity)	NA	0
b0923	MUKE	Involved in chromosome condensation, segregation and cell cycle progression. May participate in facilitating chromosome segregation by condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome during cell division. Probably acts via its interaction with MukB and MukF (By similarity)	NA	1
b0924	MUKB	Plays a central role in chromosome condensation, segregation and cell cycle progression. Functions as a homodimer, which is essential for chromosome partition. Involved in negative DNA supercoiling in vivo, and by this means organize and compact chromosomes. May achieve or facilitate chromosome segregation by condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome during cell division (By similarity)	NA	1
b1145	COHE	repressor	NA	1
b1174	MINE	Prevents the cell division inhibition by proteins MinC and MinD at internal division sites while permitting inhibition at polar sites. This ensures cell division at the proper site by restricting the formation of a division septum at the midpoint of the long axis of the cell (By similarity)	NA	5
b2412		receptor for the septal ring structure, may anchor it to the inner-membrane (By similarity)	NA	5
b2748	FTSB	Essential cell division protein. May link together the upstream cell division proteins, which are predominantly cytoplasmic, with the downstream cell division proteins, which are predominantly periplasmic (By similarity)	NA	5
b3018	PLSC	1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase	NA	5
b3249	MRED	Rod shape-determining protein MreD	NA	5
b4041	PLSB	glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase	NA	4
b4043	LEXA	Represses a number of genes involved in the response to DNA damage (SOS response), including recA and lexA. In the presence of single-stranded DNA, RecA interacts with LexA causing an autocatalytic cleavage which disrupts the DNA-binding part of LexA, leading to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually DNA repair (By similarity)	NA	5
b4361	DNAC	dna replication protein	NA	0
b4362	DNAT	it is also involved in inducing stable DNA replication during SOS response. It forms, in concert with DnaB protein and other prepriming proteins DnaC, N, N', N'' a prepriming protein complex on the specific site of the template DNA recognized by protein N' (By similarity)	NA	0
