To count the number of essential genes to annotate the leaves of the tree, I have used upsetr.R code and after running have counted the number of essential genes in each species using eg.
length(unique(list_of_essential_genes$"ROD"))
and to count the number of core genes in leaves, I have counted the number of ">"s in fasta files.
