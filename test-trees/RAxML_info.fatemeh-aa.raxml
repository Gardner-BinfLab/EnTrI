IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 27 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file ../results/make_marker/protein-fastas/markers.align.reduced

Alignment has 27 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 23988 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.70%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
