Searching sequence databases is one of the most important applications in computational molecular biology. The main workhorse in the field is the {BLAST} suite of programs. Since the introduction of {BLAST} in the 1990's, important theoretical advances in homology search methodology have been made using probabilistic inference methods and hidden Markov models ({HMMs}). However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than {BLAST} by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases. Here I describe the acceleration methods I implemented in a new, freely available profile {HMM} software package, {HMMER}3. {HMMER}3 makes profile {HMM} searches about as fast as {BLAST}, while retaining the power of using probabilistic inference technology.},

Despite the availability of multiple whole-genome sequences, the genetic differences that have driven these changes in phenotype are only beginning to be understood. In this study, we use transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing to probe differences in gene requirements for competitive growth in rich media between these two closely related serovars. We identify a conserved core of 281 genes that are required for growth in both serovars, 228 of which are essential in Escherichia coli. We are able to identify active prophage elements through the requirement for their repressors. We also find distinct differences in requirements for genes involved in cell surface structure biogenesis and iron utilization. Finally, we demonstrate that transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing is not only applicable to the protein-coding content of the cell but also has sufficient resolution to generate hypotheses regarding the functions of non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) as well. We are able to assign probable functions to a number of cis-regulatory {ncRNA} elements, as well as to infer likely differences in trans-acting {ncRNA} regulatory networks.},

Essential gene functions underpin the core reactions required for cell viability, but their contributions and relationships are poorly studied in vivo. Using {CRISPR} interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis.},

	isbn = {978-0-387-29298-4},
	shorttitle = {Bergey's Manual® of Systematic Bacteriology},
	abstract = {Since publication of the first edition of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, it has become recognized throughout the world as the principal monographic work in the field of prokaryotic biology. Like a dictionary to a writer, the Manual is usually the first reference that a microbiologist consults when questions arise regarding the characteristics of an unfamiliar species or an unknown strain that bears some similarity to a more familiar one. While the first edition has served the community well for many years, it has become outdated. As a result, the editorial board of Bergey’s Manual Trust, in collaboration with more than 500 of the world’s leading authorities in prokaryotic systematics, is in the process of revising Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology so that it reflects current thinking and advances in the field.   Background  Rapid advances in {DNA} sequencing technology have led to a major change in the way that prokaryotes are classified. Sequence analysis of highly conserved regions of the bacterial genome, such as the small subunit {rRNA} gene, now provide us with a universal method of estimating the evolutionary relationships among all organisms. Such gene-based phylogenetic classifications have led to many new discoveries about prokaryotes that were not reflected in the classification used in the first edition of the Manual. We now know that the prokaryotes fall into two broad domains: the Archaea and the Bacteria. Whereas the Archaea were once thought of as the more primitive of the prokaryotic lineages, we now realize that they are more closely related to the eukaryotes than to the Bacteria by this measure. We have come to realize that many taxa based on shared phenotypic features may be quite distinct from one another based on phylogenetic evidence. The Chromatium, a genus of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are more closely related to E. coli than to some other lineages of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria; Mycoplasma and other cell-wall deficient species are members of the Gram-positive clade; the medically important Chlamydia are aligned with the Planctomyces; and the Clostridium, which form a phenotypically coherent group, fall into more than a dozen phylogenetically disparate groups of Gram-positive bacteria. We have also come to realize that prokaryotes represent one of the major sources of biodiversity in nature and play a major role in the functioning of all ecosystems.   In addition to such fundamental revelations, the widespread application of new methods of classifying prokaryotes has led to an explosive growth in the number of validly published species and higher taxa. Since completion of the first edition of the Manual, the number of published species has more than tripled and has been accompanied by numerous taxonomic realignments that take into consideration newly published findings.   Phylogenetic classification is now broadly accepted as the preferred method of representing taxonomic relationships among prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike. While the evolutionary history of the prokaryotes is far from complete, there is already sufficient data to provide a reasonable view of the major lines of descent of the cultivable species. Although the second edition of the Manual retains it’s unique and highly structured style of presentation of information along genus and species lines, the arrangement of content is along the phylogenetic lines of the small subunit {rRNA} gene, so that the reader is presented with the information in a more natural, biological perspective. The second edition of the Manual also contains more in-depth ecological information about individual taxa and many new introductory essays.  In the preface to the first edition of Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, published in 1923, one of the stated goals of that work was to "stimulate efforts to perfect the classification of bacteria..." The editors of the first edition regarded the Manual as "a progress report leading to a more satisfactory classification in the future" rather than a definitive classification. Bergey’s Manual Trust continues in this tradition and recognizes that, for the Manual to remain scientifically meaningful and useful to the scientific community, it is time for the new edition.   Overview of the second edition of the Manual  As before, the Manual is subdivided into multiple volumes and each genus occurs as a separate chapter with introductory text provided at higher taxonomic levels. The second edition differs from the first in that clinically relevant species are not grouped together into two volumes. Rather, these taxa appear in their proper phylogenetic place. The text is arranged to follow the lineages defined by the large-scale phylogenetic trees maintained by the Ribosomal Database Project and the {ARB} Project to which a formalized, hierarchical taxonomy and nomenclature have been applied. As volume 2 goes to press, the taxonomy encompasses 6466 species that are assigned to 26 phyla, 41 classes, 88 orders, 240 families and 1194 genera. Each volume contains a collection of introductory essays on the history and use of the Manual; a detailed discussion of the prokaryotic domains; overviews of the classification, identification, and naming of prokaryotes; prokaryotic ecology and phylogeny; the role of culture collections in microbiology; and intellectual property of prokaryotes. Each volume also includes taxon specific essays and a detailed road map that presents the reader with a broad view of how the entire edition will be arranged, a mapping of phylogenetic groups to the phenotypic groups used in the first edition (Volume 1), or an update of newly published taxa and combinations appearing in print since the preceding volume (Volumes 2-5). The details of each volume in print (Volume 1), in press (Volume 2) or in preparation (Volumes 3-5) follow.  Volume 1 "The Archaea and the Deeply Branching and Phototrophic Bacteria" (2001) David R. Boone and Richard W. Castenholz (Volume Editors), George M. Garrity (Editor-in-Chief) with contributions from 105 colleagues. 742 pages with 320 figures and 95 tables.

A goal in biology is to understand the molecular and biological function of every gene in a cell. One way to approach this is to build a minimal genome that includes only the genes essential for life. In 2010, a 1079-kb genome based on the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides ({JCV}-syn1.0) was chemically synthesized and supported cell growth when transplanted into cytoplasm. Hutchison {III} et al. used a design, build, and test cycle to reduce this genome to 531 kb (473 genes). The resulting {JCV}-syn3.0 retains genes involved in key processes such as transcription and translation, but also contains 149 genes of unknown function.
Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad6253
Structured Abstract
{INTRODUCTIONIn} 1984, the simplest cells capable of autonomous growth, the mycoplasmas, were proposed as models for understanding the basic principles of life. In 1995, we reported the first complete cellular genome sequences (Haemophilus influenza, 1815 genes, and Mycoplasma genitalium, 525 genes). Comparison of these sequences revealed a conserved core of about 250 essential genes, much smaller than either genome. In 1999, we introduced the method of global transposon mutagenesis and experimentally demonstrated that M. genitalium contains many genes that are nonessential for growth in the laboratory, even though it has the smallest genome known for an autonomously replicating cell found in nature. This implied that it should be possible to produce a minimal cell that is simpler than any natural one. Whole genomes can now be built from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides and brought to life by installation into a receptive cellular environment. We have applied whole-genome design and synthesis to the problem of minimizing a cellular genome.
{RATIONALESince} the first genome sequences, there has been much work in many bacterial models to identify nonessential genes and define core sets of conserved genetic functions, using the methods of comparative genomics. Often, more than one gene product can perform a particular essential function. In such cases, neither gene will be essential, and neither will necessarily be conserved. Consequently, these approaches cannot, by themselves, identify a set of genes that is sufficient to constitute a viable genome. We set out to define a minimal cellular genome experimentally by designing and building one, then testing it for viability. Our goal is a cell so simple that we can determine the molecular and biological function of every gene.
{RESULTSWhole}-genome design and synthesis were used to minimize the 1079–kilobase pair (kbp) synthetic genome of M. mycoides {JCVI}-syn1.0. An initial design, based on collective knowledge of molecular biology in combination with limited transposon mutagenesis data, failed to produce a viable cell. Improved transposon mutagenesis methods revealed a class of quasi-essential genes that are needed for robust growth, explaining the failure of our initial design. Three more cycles of design, synthesis, and testing, with retention of quasi-essential genes, produced {JCVI}-syn3.0 (531 kbp, 473 genes). Its genome is smaller than that of any autonomously replicating cell found in nature. {JCVI}-syn3.0 has a doubling time of {\textasciitilde}180 min, produces colonies that are morphologically similar to those of {JCVI}-syn1.0, and appears to be polymorphic when examined microscopically.
{CONCLUSIONThe} minimal cell concept appears simple at first glance but becomes more complex upon close inspection. In addition to essential and nonessential genes, there are many quasi-essential genes, which are not absolutely critical for viability but are nevertheless required for robust growth. Consequently, during the process of genome minimization, there is a trade-off between genome size and growth rate. {JCVI}-syn3.0 is a working approximation of a minimal cellular genome, a compromise between small genome size and a workable growth rate for an experimental organism. It retains almost all the genes that are involved in the synthesis and processing of macromolecules. Unexpectedly, it also contains 149 genes with unknown biological functions, suggesting the presence of undiscovered functions that are essential for life. {JCVI}-syn3.0 is a versatile platform for investigating the core functions of life and for exploring whole-genome design. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/351/6280/aad6253/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Four design-build-test cycles produced {JCVI}-syn3.0.(A) The cycle for genome design, building by means of synthesis and cloning in yeast, and testing for viability by means of genome transplantation.

Determination of the universal minimal set of genes needed to sustain life is, therefore, expected to contribute greatly to our understanding of life at its simplest level, with applications in medicine and synthetic biology. The search for the minimal genome has led to the identification of often variable gene sets. We argue here that, based on the outcome of these analyses, it is becoming increasingly evident that some genes, and the functions encoded by them, are absolutely necessary for the survival of any living entity, whereas others can be omitted. We also examine ways of determining the minimal genome and discuss possible practical applications of a minimal cell.},

	abstract = {An accurate inference of orthologs is essential in many research fields such as comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and genome annotation. Existing methods for genome-scale orthology inference are mostly based on all-versus-all similarity searches that scale quadratically with the number of species. This limits their application to the increasing number of available large-scale datasets. Here, we present Hieranoid, a new orthology inference method using a hierarchical approach. Hieranoid performs pairwise orthology analysis using {InParanoid} at each node in a guide tree as it progresses from its leaves to the root. This concept reduces the total runtime complexity from a quadratic to a linear function of the number of species. The tree hierarchy provides a natural structure in multi-species ortholog groups, and the aggregation of multiple sequences allows for multiple alignment similarity searching techniques, which can yield more accurate ortholog groups. Using the recently published orthobench benchmark, Hieranoid showed the overall best performance. Our progressive approach presents a new way to infer orthologs that combines efficient graph-based methodology with aspects of compute-intensive tree-based methods. The linear scaling with the number of species is a major advantage for large-scale applications and makes Hieranoid well suited to cope with vast amounts of sequenced genomes in the future. Hieranoid is an open source and can be downloaded at Hieranoid.sbc.su.se.},

Products are bound to magnetic beads, digested with {MmeI} and barcoded with sample-specific linkers appended to each restriction fragment.

Thus, the existing protocols are not amenable to the throughput necessary to identify phenotypes and functions for the majority of genes in diverse bacteria. Here, we present a method, random bar code transposon-site sequencing ({RB}-{TnSeq}), which increases the throughput of mutant fitness profiling by incorporating random {DNA} bar codes into Tn5 and mariner transposons and by using bar code sequencing ({BarSeq}) to assay mutant fitness. {RB}-{TnSeq} can be used with any transposon, and {TnSeq} is performed once per organism instead of once per sample. Each {BarSeq} assay requires only a simple {PCR}, and 48 to 96 samples can be sequenced on one lane of an Illumina {HiSeq} system. We demonstrate the reproducibility and biological significance of {RB}-{TnSeq} with Escherichia coli, Phaeobacter inhibens, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Shewanella amazonensis, and Shewanella oneidensis. To demonstrate the increased throughput of {RB}-{TnSeq}, we performed 387 successful genome-wide mutant fitness assays representing 130 different bacterium-carbon source combinations and identified 5,196 genes with significant phenotypes across the five bacteria. In P. inhibens, we used our mutant fitness data to identify genes important for the utilization of diverse carbon substrates, including a putative d-mannose isomerase that is required for mannitol catabolism. {RB}-{TnSeq} will enable the cost-effective functional annotation of diverse bacteria using mutant fitness profiling.
{IMPORTANCE} A large challenge in microbiology is the functional assessment of the millions of uncharacterized genes identified by genome sequencing. Transposon mutagenesis coupled to next-generation sequencing ({TnSeq}) is a powerful approach to assign phenotypes and functions to genes. However, the current strategies for {TnSeq} are too laborious to be applied to hundreds of experimental conditions across multiple bacteria. Here, we describe an approach, random bar code transposon-site sequencing ({RB}-{TnSeq}), which greatly simplifies the measurement of gene fitness by using bar code sequencing ({BarSeq}) to monitor the abundance of mutants. We performed 387 genome-wide fitness assays across five bacteria and identified phenotypes for over 5,000 genes. {RB}-{TnSeq} can be applied to diverse bacteria and is a powerful tool to annotate uncharacterized genes using phenotype data.},

With this method, which we have called {TraDIS} (transposon directed insertion-site sequencing), we have been able to map 370,000 unique transposon insertion sites to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi chromosome. The unprecedented density and resolution of mapped insertion sites, an average of one every 13 base pairs, has allowed us to assay simultaneously every gene in the genome for essentiality and generate a genome-wide list of candidate essential genes. In addition, the semiquantitative nature of the assay allowed us to identify genes that are advantageous and those that are disadvantageous for growth under standard laboratory conditions. Comparison of the mutant pool following growth in the presence or absence of ox bile enabled every gene to be assayed for its contribution toward bile tolerance, a trait required of any enteric bacterium and for carriage of S. Typhi in the gall bladder. This screen validated our hypothesis that we can simultaneously assay every gene in the genome to identify niche-specific essential genes.},

A total of 446 strains differentially expressing these genes were constructed in a comprehensive platform of sensitized and resistant strains. A subset of strains allows either target underexpression or target overexpression by heterologous promoter replacements with a suite of tetracycline-regulatable promoters. A further subset of 236 antisense {RNA}-expressing clones allows knockdown expression of cognate targets. Knockdown expression confers selective antibiotic hypersensitivity, while target overexpression confers resistance. The antisense strains were configured into a {TargetArray} in which pools of sensitized strains were challenged in fitness tests.

Yet the development of new classes of antibiotics has lagged far behind our growing need for such drugs. Rather than focusing on therapeutics that target in vitro viability, much like conventional antibiotics, an alternative approach is to target functions essential for infection, such as virulence factors required to cause host damage and disease. This approach has several potential advantages including expanding the repertoire of bacterial targets, preserving the host endogenous microbiome, and exerting less selective pressure, which may result in decreased resistance. We review new approaches to targeting virulence, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and propose that in addition to targeting virulence, new antimicrobial development strategies should be expanded to include targeting bacterial gene functions that are essential for in vivo viability. We highlight both new advances in identifying these functions and prospects for antimicrobial discovery targeting this unexploited area.},

To identify a comprehensive set of genes and intergenic regions that impacts fitness in S. elongatus, we created a pooled library of ∼250,000 transposon mutants and used sequencing to identify the insertion locations. By analyzing the distribution and survival of these mutants, we identified 718 of the organism’s 2,723 genes as essential for survival under laboratory conditions. The validity of the essential gene set is supported by its tight overlap with well-conserved genes and its enrichment for core biological processes. The differences noted between our dataset and these predictors of essentiality, however, have led to surprising biological insights. One such finding is that genes in a large portion of the {TCA} cycle are dispensable, suggesting that S. elongatus does not require a cyclic {TCA} process. Furthermore, the density of the transposon mutant library enabled individual and global statements about the essentiality of noncoding {RNAs}, regulatory elements, and other intergenic regions. In this way, a group I intron located in {tRNALeu}, which has been used extensively for phylogenetic studies, was shown here to be essential for the survival of S. elongatus. Our survey of essentiality for every locus in the S. elongatus genome serves as a powerful resource for understanding the organism’s physiology and defines the essential gene set required for the growth of a photosynthetic organism.},

              Essential protein-coding sequences comprise 90\% of the essential genome; the remaining 10\% comprising essential non-coding {RNA} sequences, gene regulatory elements and essential genome replication features.
            
            
              Of the 3876 annotated open reading frames ({ORFs}), 480 (12.4\%) were essential {ORFs}, 3240 (83.6\%) were non-essential {ORFs} and 156 (4.0\%) were {ORFs} that severely impacted fitness when mutated.
            
            
              The essential elements are preferentially positioned near the origin and terminus of the Caulobacter chromosome.
            
            
              This high-resolution strategy is applicable to high-throughput, full genome essentiality studies and large-scale genetic perturbation experiments in a broad class of bacterial species.
            
          
        , The regulatory events that control polar differentiation and cell-cycle progression in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus are highly integrated, and they have to occur in the proper order (). Components of the core regulatory circuit are largely known. Full discovery of its essential genome, including non-coding, regulatory and coding elements, is a prerequisite for understanding the complete regulatory network of this bacterial cell. We have identified all the essential coding and non-coding elements of the Caulobacter chromosome using a hyper-saturated transposon mutagenesis strategy that is scalable and can be readily extended to obtain rapid and accurate identification of the essential genome elements of any sequenced bacterial species at a resolution of a few base pairs., We engineered a Tn5 derivative transposon (Tn5Pxyl) that carries at one end an inducible outward pointing Pxyl promoter (). We showed that this transposon construct inserts into the genome randomly where it can activate or disrupt transcription at the site of integration, depending on the insertion orientation. {DNA} from hundred of thousands of transposon insertion sites reading outward into flanking genomic regions was parallel {PCR} amplified and sequenced by Illumina paired-end sequencing to locate the insertion site in each mutant strain (). A single sequencing run on {DNA} from a mutagenized cell population yielded 118 million raw sequencing reads. Of these, {\textgreater}90 million ({\textgreater}80\%) read outward from the transposon element into adjacent genomic {DNA} regions and the insertion site could be mapped with single nucleotide resolution. This yielded the location and orientation of 428 735 independent transposon insertions in the 4-Mbp Caulobacter genome., Within non-coding sequences of the Caulobacter genome, we detected 130 non-disruptable {DNA} segments between 90 and 393 bp long in addition to all essential promoter elements. Among 27 previously identified and validated {sRNAs} (), three were contained within non-disruptable {DNA} segments and another three were partially disruptable, that is, insertions caused a notable growth defect. Two additional small {RNAs} found to be essential are the transfer-messenger {RNA} ({tmRNA}) and the ribozyme {RNAseP} (). In addition to the 8 non-disruptable {sRNAs}, 29 out of the 130 intergenic essential non-coding sequences contained non-redundant {tRNA} genes; duplicated {tRNA} genes were non-essential. We also identified two non-disruptable {DNA} segments within the chromosomal origin of replication. Thus, we resolved essential non-coding {RNAs}, {tRNAs} and essential replication elements within the origin region of the chromosome. An additional 90 non-disruptable small genome elements of currently unknown function were identified. Eighteen of these are conserved in at least one closely related species. Only 2 could encode a protein of over 50 amino acids., For each of the 3876 annotated open reading frames ({ORFs}), we analyzed the distribution, orientation, and genetic context of transposon insertions. There are 480 essential {ORFs} and 3240 non-essential {ORFs}. In addition, there were 156 {ORFs} that severely impacted fitness when mutated. The 8-bp resolution allowed a dissection of the essential and non-essential regions of the coding sequences. Sixty {ORFs} had transposon insertions within a significant portion of their 3′ region but lacked insertions in the essential 5′ coding region, allowing the identification of non-essential protein segments. For example, transposon insertions in the essential cell-cycle regulatory gene {divL}, a tyrosine kinase, showed that the last 204 C-terminal amino acids did not impact viability, confirming previous reports that the C-terminal {ATPase} domain of {DivL} is dispensable for viability (; ). In addition, we found that 30 out of 480 (6.3\%) of the essential {ORFs} appear to be shorter than the annotated {ORF}, suggesting that these are probably mis-annotated., Among the 480 {ORFs} essential for growth on rich media, there were 10 essential transcriptional regulatory proteins, including 5 previously identified cell-cycle regulators (; ; ; ; ) and 5 uncharacterized predicted transcription factors. In addition, two {RNA} polymerase sigma factors {RpoH} and {RpoD}, as well as the anti-sigma factor {ChrR}, which mitigates {rpoE}-dependent stress response under physiological growth conditions (), were also found to be essential. Thus, a set of 10 transcription factors, 2 {RNA} polymerase sigma factors and 1 anti-sigma factor are the core essential transcriptional regulators for growth on rich media. To further characterize the core components of the Caulobacter cell-cycle control network, we identified all essential regulatory sequences and operon transcripts. Altogether, the 480 essential protein-coding and 37 essential {RNA}-coding Caulobacter genes are organized into operons such that 402 individual promoter regions are sufficient to regulate their expression. Of these 402 essential promoters, the transcription start sites ({TSSs}) of 105 were previously identified ()., The essential genome features are non-uniformly distributed on the Caulobacter genome and enriched near the origin and the terminus regions. In contrast, the chromosomal positions of the published E. coli essential coding sequences () are preferentially located at either side of the origin (). This indicates that there are selective pressures on chromosomal positioning of some essential elements ()., The strategy described in this report could be readily extended to quickly determine the essential genome for a large class of bacterial species., Caulobacter crescentus is a model organism for the integrated circuitry that runs a bacterial cell cycle. Full discovery of its essential genome, including non-coding, regulatory and coding elements, is a prerequisite for understanding the complete regulatory network of a bacterial cell. Using hyper-saturated transposon mutagenesis coupled with high-throughput sequencing, we determined the essential Caulobacter genome at 8 bp resolution, including 1012 essential genome features: 480 {ORFs}, 402 regulatory sequences and 130 non-coding elements, including 90 intergenic segments of unknown function. The essential transcriptional circuitry for growth on rich media includes 10 transcription factors, 2 {RNA} polymerase sigma factors and 1 anti-sigma factor. We identified all essential promoter elements for the cell cycle-regulated genes. The essential elements are preferentially positioned near the origin and terminus of the chromosome. The high-resolution strategy used here is applicable to high-throughput, full genome essentiality studies and large-scale genetic perturbation experiments in a broad class of bacterial species.},

We previously developed the Transposon Directed Insertion Sequencing ({TraDIS}) protocol for this purpose, which utilizes shearing of genomic {DNA} followed by specific {PCR} amplification of transposon-containing fragments and Illumina sequencing. Here we describe an optimized high-yield library preparation and sequencing protocol for {TraDIS} experiments and a novel software pipeline for analysis of the resulting data. The Bio-Tradis analysis pipeline is implemented as an extensible Perl library which can either be used as is, or as a basis for the development of more advanced analysis tools.

Solving the architecture of such networks may provide valuable information, such as how microorganisms cause disease. Here we present a method (Tn-seq) for accurately determining quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale in microorganisms. Tn-seq is based on the assembly of a saturated Mariner transposon insertion library. After library selection, changes in frequency of each insertion mutant are determined by sequencing the flanking regions en masse. These changes are used to calculate each mutant's fitness. Using this approach, we determined fitness for each gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of pneumonia and meningitis. A genome-wide screen for genetic interactions of five query genes identified both alleviating and aggravating interactions that could be divided into seven distinct categories. Owing to the wide activity of the Mariner transposon, Tn-seq has the potential to contribute to the exploration of complex pathways across many different species.},

	abstract = {Rapid genome-wide identification of genes required for infection would expedite studies of bacterial pathogens. We developed genome-scale “negative selection” technology that combines high-density transposon mutagenesis and massively parallel sequencing of transposon/chromosome junctions in a mutant library to identify mutants lost from the library after exposure to a selective condition of interest. This approach was applied to comprehensively identify Haemophilus influenzae genes required to delay bacterial clearance in a murine pulmonary model. Mutations in 136 genes resulted in defects in vivo, and quantitative estimates of fitness generated by this technique were in agreement with independent validation experiments using individual mutant strains. Genes required in the lung included those with characterized functions in other models of H. influenzae pathogenesis and genes not previously implicated in infection. Genes implicated in vivo have reported or potential roles in survival during nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and exposure to antimicrobial membrane perturbations, suggesting that these conditions are encountered by H. influenzae during pulmonary infection. The results demonstrate an efficient means to identify genes required for bacterial survival in experimental models of pathogenesis, and this approach should function similarly well in selections conducted in vitro and in vivo with any organism amenable to insertional mutagenesis.},
